# Go Hug a Panda

[Play here.](http://www.bizwacky.com/ghap/ghap.html)

Not much can be said about this little "game." Just find the panda.

The game runs entirely using HTML5 and Javascript, built with 
[Haxe](http://haxe.org/). All graphics are original and all code is original, 
except the use of jQuery and the Haxe standard library.

## Instructions

To build the game, run:

```sh
haxe ghap.hxml
./release.sh
```

Then open the file `dist/ghap.html` in your browser and enjoy!

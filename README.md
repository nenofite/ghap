# Go Hug a Panda

[Play here.](http://www.bizwacky.com/ghap/ghap.html)

Not much can be said about this little "game." Just find the panda.

It runs entirely using HTML5 and Javascript. It was built with Haxe.

All graphics are original. All code is original, except the use of jQuery and 
the Haxe standard library.
